# Legacy Technical Notes

This file explains how to interpret historical engineering notes in this repository.

## Purpose

Several markdown files capture design sessions, implementation snapshots, and validation logs.
They remain valuable for context but are not the primary source for current setup and operations.

## How to read them

1. Use canonical docs first (`docs/README.md`, `QUICKSTART.md`, `DOCKER_SETUP.md`).
2. Use legacy notes for background and decision history.
3. Treat commands/paths in older notes as historical unless they match current docs.

## Typical legacy files

- `SESSION_SUMMARY.md`
- `UI-FIXES-VERIFIED.md`
- `DETECTION_ANALYSIS_AND_FIXES.md`
- `DEMO_LOOP_COMPLETE.md`
- `YARP_LEARNING_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- Project-level `*_SUMMARY.md`, `*_STATUS.md`, and `*_COMPLETE.md` files
