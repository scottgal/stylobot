Below is a **full whitepaper-style draft**, written in a professional but accessible tone, aligned with your
philosophy (ephemeral windows, behavioural detectors, zero-PII signals, foveated markets, transparent economic
incentives).
It positions Stylocoin as the world’s first **privacy-preserving behavioural training economy** for a semantic firewall.

# **STYLOCOIN: A FOVEATED MARKET FOR PRIVACY-PRESERVING BEHAVIOURAL INTELLIGENCE**

### *Whitepaper Draft v0.9 — Mostlylucid Research*

---

## **Abstract**

Stylocoin is a **non-tradeable, internal training credit** that powers the collaborative evolution of the Stylowall
Semantic Firewall.
It enables a foveated marketplace where:

* participants contribute **anonymous behavioural telemetry**,
* detectors and tools contribute **specialised analytic capability**, and
* Stylowall continuously adjusts **pricing, rewards, and reputation signals** based on transparent mathematical utility
  models.

Stylocoin is **not a cryptocurrency**, nor a security token.
It cannot be exchanged for money, transferred externally, or speculated upon.
It is a **closed-circuit incentive system** used solely to:

* reward useful behavioural signatures,
* price detector operations based on cost and value,
* fund community buyouts of high-value tools,
* and maintain a self-optimising detector ecosystem that improves in real time.

Stylocoin is the first currency designed for **zero-PII behavioural intelligence** and **continuous, decentralised
detector refinement**.

---

## **1. Motivation**

Bot detection and behavioural security tools traditionally rely on:

* centralised data collection,
* retained PII,
* opaque heuristics,
* static or slow-moving models, and
* vendor-locked training data.

Stylowall rejects all of this.

Instead, Stylowall is based on the **Ephemeral Model**:

* signals exist only inside a rolling window;
* no raw PII is ever stored;
* identifiers are zero-reversible HMAC signatures;
* detectors compete and collaborate inside a runtime marketplace;
* and usefulness is measured, not assumed.

This creates a new problem:
**How do you reward the community for producing high-quality behavioural signals without compromising privacy or
exposing raw data?**

Stylocoin solves this.

---

## **2. Core Design Principles**

### **2.1 Zero-PII by Construction**

Stylowall uses:

* HMAC-based zero-reversible signatures,
* foveated behavioural summaries,
* ephemeral windows,
* typed signals,
* and abstracted user profiles.

No raw IPs, UAs, or identifiers are ever retained.

Stylocoin, therefore, does *not* reward individuals.
It rewards **behaviour classes**, **signature archetypes**, and **detector-shaping events**.

### **2.2 Foveated Market**

Foveation means:

> *The system focuses computational and economic attention only where precision is needed.*

Consequence:

* mundane human activity is cheap
* high-uncertainty or novel activity is valuable
* rare bot behaviours are extremely valuable
* adversarial patterns command premium payouts
* stability reduces cost; novelty increases reward

This mirrors biological foveation in vision:
you spend energy only where detail matters.

### **2.3 Transparency**

Every participant sees:

* the cost in Gold to run a detector,
* its utility score,
* vendor reputation,
* signature-maker reputation,
* adjustment curves for pricing,
* and community fund allocations.

Nothing is hidden.
Stylowall is *inspectable*.

### **2.4 Predictive, Not Reactive**

Stylocoin values **signals that improve future detection**, not just classify current traffic.
This includes:

* detector disagreements,
* ambiguous sequences,
* novel timing behaviours,
* unseen header combinations,
* evolving tool fingerprints,
* and real-time anomaly clusters.

Stylowall literally pays you when you help it see what it did not previously see.

---

## **3. Stylocoin Economy**

Stylocoin is a **unit of useful behavioural training potential**.

It has:

* **a fixed internal USD equivalent**
  (for pricing detector compute and vendor payouts)
* **no withdrawal mechanism**
* **no speculative market**
* **no external transferability**

Within the system, Stylocoin enables:

* tool access
* simulation runs
* advanced packs
* high-resolution dashboards
* and participation in detector evolution

---

## **4. Earnings Model: Utility-Weighted Rewards**

You earn Stylocoin whenever your traffic produces **utility**.

Utility is calculated as:

> **U = novelty × ambiguity × detector_jitter × predictive_gain × rarity × cost_to_evaluate**

Where:

### **4.1 Novelty**

How different the behavioural signature is from the known space.

### **4.2 Ambiguity**

How much detector disagreement existed.

### **4.3 Detector Jitter**

The variance in output when run across evolving packs.

### **4.4 Predictive Gain**

How much the signal sharpens future classification.

### **4.5 Rarity**

Frequency-adjusted reward — rare events are more valuable.

### **4.6 Cost-to-Evaluate**

Harder detectors (e.g., semantic LLMs) cost more but also *reward* more.

This allows *precision pricing*:
you are paid relative to what your signal is worth to the network.

---

## **5. Spending Stylocoin: The Tool Marketplace**

Detectors, tools, and packs have:

* **cost to operate**
* **utility score**
* **vendor reputation score**
* **community rating**
* **runtime compute demand**

The Gold price for operating a tool is dynamically adjusted by:

> **Price = cost × (1 + utility_gain_factor) × market_demand × vendor_trust**

Tools that:

* produce strong results
* are computationally heavy
* or highly requested

naturally rise in price.

Tools that:

* provide negligible improvement
* regress
* or create noise

fall in price and reputation.

This ecosystem is **self-optimising, competitive, and transparent**.

---

## **6. Tool Vendor and Community Fund**

Vendors can register detectors and declare:

* **their cost model**
* **their minimum upkeep price in USD**
* **a “cash-out” acquisition cost**
* **licensing preferences**
* **community contribution status**

As detectors gain usage and utility, Stylowall collects a portion of operational Gold into a **Community Fund**.

This fund can:

1. **Buy out tools** to make them free-tier public detectors
2. **Incentivise creation** of detectors targeting emerging threats
3. **Stabilise the economy** during rapid adversarial shifts
4. **Support vendors** building complex or high-compute packs

A tool vendor may declare:

> “I am willing to sell this detector to the Community Fund for 150,000 Gold.”

If the fund reaches that amount, the tool becomes **free for all users**, and the vendor is paid the internal USD
equivalent (not withdrawn, but applied to service credit or contract payment).

This **democratises high-end detection**, without undermining the marketplace.

---

## **7. Specialisation of Detectors (Evolution)**

Stylowall encourages detectors to become **narrower**, not broader.

This produces:

* higher precision
* lower cost
* improved explainability
* easier A/B testing
* modularity of packs
* faster evolutionary cycles

Detectors that specialise naturally:

* cost less to run,
* earn more reputation,
* and have clearer community value.

This matches real-world security dynamics:
adversaries specialise → defenders specialise more quickly.

Stylocoin funds this cycle.

---

## **8. Foveated Adaptive Pricing**

The system constantly recalculates dynamic pricing based on:

* global detector performance
* emerging threat clusters
* compute pressure
* behavioural entropy
* marginal predictive gain curves
* vendor reputation decay
* community fund health

Pricing adjusts **gently**, like a regulatory mechanism, not a volatile market.

Participants always see:

* yesterday’s price
* today’s price
* tomorrow's projected price
* the variables influencing the change

Radical transparency is essential to trust.

---

## **9. Privacy Guarantees**

Stylocoin is built on four commitments:

### **9.1 Zero PII Stored**

All identifiers are irreversible HMAC signatures.

### **9.2 Ephemeral Behaviour Windows**

Signals exist only within rolling, short-lived windows.

### **9.3 Foveated Abstraction**

Only useful behavioural summaries are retained as training vectors.

### **9.4 Mathematical Audibility**

Statistical proofs demonstrate:

* no individual can be reconstructed
* no PII exists in stored signatures
* no behaviour can be tied to a legal identity

This is **privacy by design**, not privacy by policy.

---

## **10. Why Stylocoin Works**

Because:

* behaviour is valuable
* privacy can be preserved
* incentives shape evolution
* detectors improve only when fed real traffic
* a global market of signals is far stronger than isolated vendors
* transparency creates trust
* foveation ensures efficiency
* non-tradeability avoids regulatory burden

Stylocoin forms the **economic backbone of the first semantic intelligence firewall**.

---

## **11. Future Extensions**

* signature lineage tracking
* foveated LLM co-training
* gold-based simulation refinement loops
* adversarial attacker bounties
* federated behavioural aggregation
* enterprise-tier consensus panels
* source-specific calibration markets
* cloud-to-edge detector distillation

---

## **Conclusion**

Stylocoin is not money.
It is **signal-energy**, a measure of how much your behaviour sharpens the Stylowall engine.

In this foveated market:

* useful signals earn more
* high-utility tools cost more
* the best detectors get funded
* and the entire community benefits from continuous refinement

All while preserving **absolute privacy**.

Stylocoin turns the world’s behavioural noise into a continuously improving defence system —
the first **Forensic Semantic Intelligence Marketplace**.
