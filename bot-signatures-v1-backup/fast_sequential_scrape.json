  "reasoning": "The scenario exhibits rapid, low-delay requests (all \u003C0.1s) with a deliberate sequence of paths targeting product data, reviews, and related content. The repeated identical User-Agent string and lack of human-like delays strongly suggest automated scraping behavior. The aggressive pacing and specific data extraction patterns are hallmarks of bot activity."
