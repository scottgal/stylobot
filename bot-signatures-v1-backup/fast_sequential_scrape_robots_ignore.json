  "reasoning": "The scenario exhibits rapid, sequential requests (\u003C0.1s delays) targeting sensitive endpoints (admin/export, static/private/data) and search queries. The mix of successful and blocked responses suggests automated probing, while the lack of delay between requests indicates a scraping bot. The User-Agent \u0027Go-http-client/2.0\u0027 is commonly associated with scraping tools, and the aggressive path selection violates typical human browsing patterns."
