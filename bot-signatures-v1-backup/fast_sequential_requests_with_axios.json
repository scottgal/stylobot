The paths follow a logical but suspicious sequence (products \u2192 reviews \u2192 cart \u2192 checkout), which is often used in automated data extraction. The consistent use of the \u0027axios/1.6.2\u0027 user-agent further reinforces the bot-like behavior, as human users typically vary their user agents."
