  "reasoning": "The scenario exhibits rapid, low-delay requests across multiple unrelated endpoints (e.g., product listings, reviews, cart) with identical, generic User-Agent strings. This pattern is characteristic of automated scrapers that bypass human-like navigation delays and exploit multiple pages in parallel to extract data efficiently. The absence of referrer headers or session cookies further suggests automated behavior rather than organic user activity."
